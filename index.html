    <p style="padding-left:20px;font-size:18px">The Gospel Makes us "Natural"</p>
    <p style="padding-left:20px;font-size:16px">
      Paul highlights how the inward bent of sin creates such dysfunction and disorder that we defy the sovereign lordship of Christ, pursuing abnormal and
      unnatural relations as if they were natural and normal. In <span style="color:rgba(255,0,0,0.55)">Romans 1:26-27</span>, Paul comments on the sinfulness
      of homosexuality and how it deviates from the "natural" and is instead "contrary to nature" and "shameless". Elsewhere Paul writes that before salvation we
      <span style="color:rgba(255,0,0,0.55)">"lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind" (Ephesians 2:3)</span>
      The corollary to this truth is that after salvation, even as we become more and more conformed to the image of Christ, we are also becoming more and more our
      true selves. As the fruit of the Spirit increases in us, God restores order within us. Our minds are renewed <span style="color:rgba(255,0,0,0.55)">(Romans 12:2)</span>
      . We learn to do the natural thing spiritually and the spiritual thing naturally.

    <p style="padding-left:20px;font-size:18px">Idolatry</p>
    <p style="padding-left:20px;font-size:16px">
      Paul shows us that the fundamental problem of human existence is the worship of false gods. Idolatry is the root of sin. He outlines the problem with humanity
      in this way: <span style="color:rgba(255,0,0,0.55)">"Claiming to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling
        mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things..." (Romans 1:22-23)</span>. He continues by saying, <span style="color:rgba(255,0,0,0.55)">
          "They exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever!" (Romans 1:25)</span>.
          Humans are never <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> worshiping. The story of Israel in the Old Testament shows God's people continually struggling
          to trust the Lord and lapsing again into idolatry.

          </span>
          <br>
          God is "giving up" unrepentant sinners to their sin. In allowing sin to persist and harden a person's heart, God maintains his sovereignty in a way that does not
          negate human responsibility. The clearest example is in the way God dealt with Pharoah in the book of Exodus. We read that Pharoah harded his heart
          <span style="color:rgba(255,0,0,0.55)">(Exodus 8:15,32)</span>, but we also read that God hardened Pharoah's heart <span style="color:rgba(255,0,0,0.55)">(Exodus 4:21, 7:3, 9:12)</span>.
          So which is it? In the mystery of God's sovereignty and human responsibility, we learn that the answer is "both". Sinners are responsible for their hard hearts, yet God
          is sovereign over human activity.

        <p style="padding-left:20px;font-size:18px">General Revelation</p>
        <p style="padding-left:20px;font-size:16px">
          <span style="color:rgba(255,0,0,0.55)">Romans 1:19-20</span> sounds very similar to <span style="color:rgba(255,0,0,0.55)">Psalm 19:1</span>. The theological concept
          here is what is commonly called the doctrine of "general revelation". Drawn from the Scriptures, this idea is that God reveals himself in the created world.
          This does not claim that everything we need to know about God and his gospel in Christ is intelligible from the natural world. Gospel knowledge necessitates what is called
          "special revelation", which refers to God's Word in the flesh (Jesus) and God's Word written down (Bible). With general revelation, it does mean that there is enough
          of God's glory revealed in creation to leave sinners with no excuse for their unbelief and idolatry <span style="color:rgba(255,0,0,0.55)">(Romans 1:20)</span>.
