        <span id="verseNumber">[18]</span> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. <span id="verseNumber">[19]</span> For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. <span id="verseNumber">[20]</span> For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. <span id="verseNumber">[21]</span> For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. <span id="verseNumber">[22]</span> Claiming to be wise, they became fools, <span id="verseNumber">[23]</span> and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.
        <span id="verseNumber">[24]</span> Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, <span id="verseNumber">[25]</span> because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.
        <span id="verseNumber">[26]</span> For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; <span id="verseNumber">[27]</span> and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.
        <span id="verseNumber">[28]</span> And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. <span id="verseNumber">[29]</span> They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, <span id="verseNumber">[30]</span> slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,
        <span id="verseNumber">[31]</span> foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. <span id="verseNumber">[32]</span> Though they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.
